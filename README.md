- üéØ Touch and swipe support for mobile devices
- üé® Beautiful color scheme matching the original game
- üìä Score tracking with best score persistence
- üéâ Celebration effects on reaching 2048
- ‚öôÔ∏è Customizable settings:
  - Animation speed control
  - Confetti effect toggle
- üîÑ Game state management:
  - "Game Over" detection
  - "You Win" celebration
  - Continue playing after winning
- üí´ Enhanced visual feedback:

## How to Play

1. Use arrow keys (‚Üë ‚Üì ‚Üê ‚Üí) or swipe gestures to move tiles
2. Click and drag tiles to preview movements
3. Tiles with the same number merge when they collide
4. After each move, a new tile appears (2 or 4)
5. Combine tiles to reach 2048!

## Getting Started

Simply clone the repository and open `index.html` in your web browser:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/2048-game.git
cd 2048-game
```

No build process or dependencies required - it's pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!

## Development Metrics

This project includes detailed development metrics tracking in `session_metrics.csv`. The file tracks various aspects of the development process, particularly focusing on the AI-assisted development workflow using the Cascade feature in Windsurf IDE.

### Metrics Structure

The CSV file contains the following columns:

#### Time and Identification
- `Timestamp`: UTC timestamp of when the prompt was sent
- `Prompt_Number`: Sequential number of prompts in the project
- `Commit_Hash`: Associated Git commit hash for the changes

#### Resource Usage
- `Tokens_Input`: Number of tokens in the user's prompt
- `Tokens_Output`: Number of tokens in the AI's response
- `Duration_Seconds`: Time taken to complete the task
- `Tool_Calls`: Number of Cascade tool calls made
- `Tools_Used`: List of specific tools utilized in the task

#### Code Impact
- `Lines_Changed`: Number of code lines modified/added/deleted
- `Files_Modified`: Number of files affected by the changes

#### Task Analysis
- `Task_Category`: Type of task (setup, feature, bugfix, enhancement, documentation)
- `Task_Complexity`: Estimated complexity (low, medium, high)
- `Iterations_Required`: Number of attempts needed to complete the task
- `Success_Rate`: Task completion success (0-1, where 1 means completed in first attempt)
- `Description`: Brief description of the changes or purpose of the prompt

### Using the Metrics

This data can be analyzed to:
- Measure Cascade's effectiveness in different types of tasks
- Track development velocity and efficiency
- Identify patterns in tool usage and task complexity
- Calculate success rates for different task categories
- Estimate time savings compared to manual development
- Evaluate the learning curve of AI-assisted development

The data can be visualized using tools like Excel, Google Sheets, or any data visualization library to generate insights about:
- Most common task types and their success rates
- Correlation between task complexity and completion time
- Tool usage patterns and effectiveness
- Development velocity over time
- Resource efficiency (tokens vs. code changes)

### Current Development Insights

Based on the metrics collected during this project's development:

#### Project Overview
- Total Prompts: 20
- Total Lines Changed: 873
- Files Modified: 34 (cumulative)
- Overall Success Rate: 85%

Note: While we track timestamps and durations, actual development time metrics should be interpreted with caution as they may not accurately reflect real development time due to:
- Gaps between commits not necessarily indicating breaks
- Development work that happens between tracked interactions
- Variable time spent on thinking and planning
- Potential parallel tasks and context switching

#### Task Distribution
- Features: 35% (7 tasks)
- Enhancements: 20% (4 tasks)
- Bugfixes: 15% (3 tasks)
- Documentation: 15% (3 tasks)
- Setup: 5% (1 task)

#### Efficiency Metrics
- Average Time per Task: 216 seconds (~3.6 minutes)
- Average Lines per Task: 44 lines
- Average Tool Calls per Task: 3.5
- Most Used Tools: view_file, edit_file, run_command

#### Success Patterns
- High Complexity Tasks: 80% success rate
- Medium Complexity Tasks: 90% success rate
- Low Complexity Tasks: 100% success rate
- Most Challenging: Mobile touch support and confetti implementation (required 2 iterations)
- Most Efficient: Documentation and simple bugfixes (100% success, minimal iterations)

#### Resource Usage
- Average Input Tokens: 133 tokens
- Average Output Tokens: 735 tokens
- Token Efficiency: ~5.5x output/input ratio

#### Key Observations
1. Cascade excels at:
   - Quick documentation updates
   - Simple bugfixes
   - Feature enhancements
   - Code refactoring

2. Areas requiring more iterations:
   - Complex UI interactions (touch events)
   - Visual effects (confetti)
   - Cross-device compatibility

3. Development Velocity:
   - Fastest: Documentation tasks (~60-120 seconds)
   - Moderate: Feature additions (~240-300 seconds)
   - Slowest: Complex features/bugfixes (~360-420 seconds)

These insights demonstrate Cascade's effectiveness in rapidly developing a complete web game, with particularly strong performance in documentation and straightforward feature implementation. The tool shows consistent success rates across different task complexities, with slightly more iteration needed for complex UI and visual features.
