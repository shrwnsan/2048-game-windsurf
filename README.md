# 2048 Game v1.0

A modern implementation of the classic 2048 puzzle game with smooth animations, touch support, and enhanced visual feedback.

## Features

- 🎮 Classic 2048 gameplay mechanics
- ✨ Smooth animations for tile movements and merges
- 📱 Responsive design - works on both desktop and mobile
- 🎯 Touch and swipe support for mobile devices
- 🎨 Beautiful color scheme matching the original game
- 📊 Score tracking with best score persistence
- 🎉 Celebration effects on reaching 2048
- ⚙️ Customizable settings:
  - Animation speed control
  - Confetti effect toggle
- 🔄 Game state management:
  - "Game Over" detection
  - "You Win" celebration
  - Continue playing after winning
- 💫 Enhanced visual feedback:
  - Tile movement preview
  - Merge possibility indicators
  - Direction hints while dragging
- 🖼️ Custom favicon

## How to Play

1. Use arrow keys (↑ ↓ ← →) or swipe gestures to move tiles
2. Click and drag tiles to preview movements
3. Tiles with the same number merge when they collide
4. After each move, a new tile appears (2 or 4)
5. Combine tiles to reach 2048!

## Getting Started

Simply clone the repository and open `index.html` in your web browser:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/2048-game.git
cd 2048-game
```

No build process or dependencies required - it's pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!

## Development Metrics

This project includes detailed development metrics tracking in `session_metrics.csv`. The file tracks various aspects of the development process, particularly focusing on the AI-assisted development workflow using the Cascade feature in Windsurf IDE.

### Metrics Structure

The CSV file contains the following columns:

#### Time and Identification
- `Timestamp`: UTC timestamp of when the prompt was sent
- `Prompt_Number`: Sequential number of prompts in the project
- `Commit_Hash`: Associated Git commit hash for the changes

#### Resource Usage
- `Tokens_Input`: Number of tokens in the user's prompt
- `Tokens_Output`: Number of tokens in the AI's response
- `Duration_Seconds`: Time taken to complete the task
- `Tool_Calls`: Number of Cascade tool calls made
- `Tools_Used`: List of specific tools utilized in the task

#### Code Impact
- `Lines_Changed`: Number of code lines modified/added/deleted
- `Files_Modified`: Number of files affected by the changes

#### Task Analysis
- `Task_Category`: Type of task (setup, feature, bugfix, enhancement, documentation)
- `Task_Complexity`: Estimated complexity (low, medium, high)
- `Iterations_Required`: Number of attempts needed to complete the task
- `Success_Rate`: Task completion success (0-1, where 1 means completed in first attempt)
- `Description`: Brief description of the changes or purpose of the prompt

### Using the Metrics

This data can be analyzed to:
- Measure Cascade's effectiveness in different types of tasks
- Track development velocity and efficiency
- Identify patterns in tool usage and task complexity
- Calculate success rates for different task categories
- Estimate time savings compared to manual development
- Evaluate the learning curve of AI-assisted development

The data can be visualized using tools like Excel, Google Sheets, or any data visualization library to generate insights about:
- Most common task types and their success rates
- Correlation between task complexity and completion time
- Tool usage patterns and effectiveness
- Development velocity over time
- Resource efficiency (tokens vs. code changes)
