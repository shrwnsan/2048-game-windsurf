# 2048 Game - Windsurf IDE Demo

A modern implementation of the classic 2048 puzzle game, developed using Windsurf IDE's Cascade feature. This project serves as a demonstration of AI-assisted development using Claude 3.5 Sonnet and ChatGPT 4.

## Features

- 🎮 Classic 2048 gameplay mechanics
- ✨ Smooth animations for tile movements and merges
- 📱 Responsive design - works on both desktop and mobile
- 🎯 Touch and swipe support for mobile devices
- 🎨 Beautiful color scheme matching the original game
- 📊 Score tracking with best score persistence
- 🎉 Celebration effects on reaching 2048
- ⚙️ Customizable settings:
  - Animation speed control
  - Confetti effect toggle
- 🔄 Game state management:
  - "Game Over" detection
  - "You Win" celebration
  - Continue playing after winning
- 💫 Enhanced visual feedback:
  - Tile movement preview
  - Merge possibility indicators
  - Direction hints while dragging
- 🖼️ Custom favicon

## How to Play

1. Use arrow keys (↑ ↓ ← →) or WASD keys to move tiles
2. Click and drag tiles to preview movements
3. Tiles with the same number merge when they collide
4. After each move, a new tile appears (2 or 4)
5. Combine tiles to reach 2048!

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and open `index.html` in your web browser:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shrwnsan/2048-game-windsurf.git
cd 2048-game-windsurf
```

No build process or dependencies required - it's pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!

## Development Metrics

This project uses detailed metrics to track development progress and AI assistance effectiveness. The metrics are stored in `session_metrics.csv` and include:

### Metrics Structure

The CSV file contains the following columns:

#### Time and Identification
- `Timestamp`: UTC timestamp of when the prompt was sent
- `Prompt_Number`: Sequential number of prompts in the project
- `Commit_Hash`: Associated Git commit hash for the changes

#### Resource Usage
- `Tokens_Input`: Number of tokens in the user's prompt
- `Tokens_Output`: Number of tokens in the AI's response
- `Duration_Seconds`: Time taken to complete the task
- `Tool_Calls`: Number of Cascade tool calls made
- `Tools_Used`: List of specific tools utilized in the task

#### Code Impact
- `Lines_Changed`: Number of code lines modified/added/deleted
- `Files_Modified`: Number of files affected by the changes

#### Task Analysis
- `Task_Category`: Type of task (setup, feature, bugfix, enhancement, documentation)
- `Task_Complexity`: Estimated complexity (low, medium, high)
- `Iterations_Required`: Number of attempts needed to complete the task
- `Success_Rate`: Task completion success (0-1, where 1 means completed in first attempt)
- `Description`: Brief description of the changes or purpose of the prompt
- `Model`: AI model used (Claude 3.5 Sonnet)

### Using the Metrics

This data can be analyzed to:
- Measure Cascade's effectiveness in different types of tasks
- Track development velocity and efficiency
- Identify patterns in tool usage and task complexity
- Calculate success rates for different task categories
- Evaluate the learning curve of AI-assisted development

The data can be visualized using tools like Excel, Google Sheets, or any data visualization library to generate insights about:
- Most common task types and their success rates
- Correlation between task complexity and completion time
- Tool usage patterns and effectiveness
- Development velocity over time
- Resource efficiency (tokens vs. code changes)

## Development Insights

The following metrics represent a subset of the project's development activity, tracked through one Cascade workflow:

#### Project Overview
- Total Lines Changed: 873
- Files Modified: 34 (cumulative)
- Overall Success Rate: 85%
- Model: Claude 3.5 Sonnet

Note: Development of this project involved multiple workflows and direct Claude interactions, which are not reflected in these metrics. The total development effort, including all Claude conversations and Cascade sessions, would be significantly higher.

#### Development Timeline
- Initial Development: November 16, 2024
- Major Refactoring: November 17, 2024
- Current Version: 1.1.0
